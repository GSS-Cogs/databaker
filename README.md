# databaker

Databaker is a command line tool to convert spreadsheets to databases,
made for the UK's Office for National Statistics by the [Sensible Code
Company](http://sensiblecode.io).

We currently support Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.

## Documentation

The current documentation is in the form of Jupyter notebooks located
inside the [tutorial](databaker/tutorial) directory.

You can access these directly by creating a new Jupyter notebook and
running the following in a Jupyter cell:

```
from databaker.tutorial import tutorial
tutorial()
```

which will copy the tutorials to your current directory and provide
links to these copied notebooks.
