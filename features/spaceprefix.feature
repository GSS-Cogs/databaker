Feature: Define dimension using bag.spaceprefix(count)
    I want to be able to define a dimension by identifying all items in a bag 
    which contain values prefixed by the same number of whitespace characters.

    Scenario Outline: Define income type by number of whitespace characters prefixing each value
        Given we load a file named <File Name>
        And select the sheet "Table A"
        And we define cell selections as
        | key             | value                                                |  
        | income_type     | tab.excel_ref("B").spaceprefix(5).is_not_blank()     |
        Then we confirm the cell selection contains "20" cells.
        And we confirm the cell selection is equal to:
        """
        {<B36 '     Trade in services'>, <B42 '     Other primary income'>, <B12 '     Trade in services'>, <B20 '     Total primary income'>, <B41 '     Investment income'>, <B40 '     Compensation of employees'>, <B46 '     General government'>, <B18 '     Other primary income'>, <B49 '     Total secondary income'>, <B44 '     Total primary income'>, <B47 '     Other sectors'>, <B14 '     Total trade'>, <B35 '     Trade in goods'>, <B25 '     Total secondary income'>, <B22 '     General government'>, <B11 '     Trade in goods'>, <B17 '     Investment income'>, <B16 '     Compensation of employees'>, <B38 '     Total trade'>, <B23 '     Other sectors'>}
        """

            | File Name                         |
            | "balanceofpayments2020q1.xls"     |
            | "balanceofpayments2020q1.xlsx"    |
