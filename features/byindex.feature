Feature: Define a dimension by accessing the element at index n in a bag of cells.
    If I have a bag of cells but want to define a dimension as a single cells
    within the bag, I want to be able to access that value by its index in the bag.

    Scenario Outline: Define by index unit from its index in the row 5 bag.
        Given we load a file named <File Name>
        And select the sheet "Sheet2"
        And we define cell selections as
        | key             | value                                        |  
        | unit            | tab.excel_ref("A5"+":Z5").by_index(16)       |
        Then we confirm the cell selection is the correct type.
        """
        <class 'xypath.xypath.Bag'>
        """
        And we confirm the cell selection is equal to:
        """
        {<P5 '(Â£Million)'>}
        """

            | "bakingtestdataset.xlsx"        | 
            | "bakingtestdataset.ods"         |
