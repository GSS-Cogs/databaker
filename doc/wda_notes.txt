Final row =
*********, <observation count>

Where there are multiple sets of dimensions one set must come first

e.g.

4,x=5,y=6
7,x=12,y=25
0,x=6,z=0
12,x=9,z=99

note all x/y before any x/z

Likewise if some obs are counts, and some are percentages

Likewise keep together obs with the same number of dimensions
